differences hashmap hashtable,"there are several differences between hashmap and hashtable in java:
hashmap, hashtable in case of hash collisions they store the map entries in linked lists. from java8 for hashmap if hash bucket grows beyond a certain threshold, that bucket will switch from linked list of entries to a balanced tree. which improve worst-case performance from o(n) to o(log n). while converting the list to binary tree, hashcode is used as a branching variable. if there are two different hashcodes in the same bucket, one is considered bigger and goes to the right of the tree and other one to the left. but when both the hashcodes are equal, hashmap assumes that the keys are comparable, and compares the key to determine the direction so that some order can be maintained. it is a good practice to make the keys of hashmap comparable. on adding entries if bucket size reaches treeify_threshold = 8 convert linked list of entries to a balanced tree, on removing entries less than treeify_threshold and at most untreeify_threshold = 6 will reconvert balanced tree to linked list of entries. java 8 src, stackpost
keep in mind that hashtable was legacy class before java collections framework (jcf) was introduced and was later retrofitted to implement the map interface. so was vector and stack.
third difference on hashtable vs hashmap is that hashtable is obsolete class and you should be using concurrenthashmap in place of hashtable in java.
hashmap and hashtable have significant algorithmic differences as well. no one has mentioned this before so that's why i am bringing it up. hashmap will construct a hash table with power of two size, increase it dynamically such that you have at most about eight elements (collisions) in any bucket and will stir the elements very well for general element types. however, the hashtable implementation provides better and finer control over the hashing if you know what you are doing, namely you can fix the table size using e.g. the closest prime number to your values domain size and this will result in better performance than hashmap i.e. less collisions for some cases."
